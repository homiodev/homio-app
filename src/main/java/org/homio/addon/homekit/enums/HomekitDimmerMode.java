/**
 * Dimmer commands are handled differently by different devices.
 * Some devices expect only the brightness updates, some others expect brightness as well as "On/Off" commands.
 * This enum describes different modes of dimmer handling in the context of HomeKit binding.
 * <p>
 * Following modes are supported:
 * DIMMER_MODE_NORMAL - no filtering. The commands will be sent to a device as received from HomeKit.
 * DIMMER_MODE_FILTER_ON - ON events are filtered out. Only OFF and brightness information is sent
 * DIMMER_MODE_FILTER_BRIGHTNESS_100 - only Brightness=100% is filtered out. Everything else is unchanged. This allows
 * custom logic for soft launch in devices.
 * DIMMER_MODE_FILTER_ON_EXCEPT_BRIGHTNESS_100 - ON events are filtered out in all cases except of Brightness = 100%.
